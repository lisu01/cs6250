*Unit tests for dns_firewall.py
------------------------------
 1)Test that requests (as opposed to responses) are permitted.
 2)Test that a response to a prior request is permitted, but only once ( prevent malicious repeat send of legitimate responses ).
 3)Test that a response without a prior request is not permitted.
 4) Test that two valid responses are allowed regardless of the order in which they arrive.
 5) Test that the same request / response are allowed repeatedly ( supports refetch of data once TTL expires or in case of lost response ).
 6) Test that a valid response will be accepted despite being preceded by invalid responses.
